Playback could be sensitive to spreadsheet layout. Increased flexibility but also may be harder to start live coding if there isn't a fixed structure to adhere to.

Could evaluate the success of the representation compression with people.

Office JS - public API. If it's possible to extend this, that would be best as it's free from IP and can be done in JavaScript. Then make an ad-din which would read strings (not formulae) from the cells. The add-in has access to everything in the grid.

Timing with "request animation frame"

CV is probably a bit of a red herring. Instead focusing on the ways spreadsheets allow musical expression.

Participatory design with musicians. 

API could be evaluated by:

* translation of a corpus evidences expressiveness of API
* distribution of number of formulae compared to formulae in a spreadsheet corpus
* User study for learnability/usability

Luke Church may have ideas on quantitative metrics.

Remind Advait to send example proposals and SheetMusic.
