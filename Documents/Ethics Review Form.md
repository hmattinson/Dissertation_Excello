#### Title of research project

Music Generation in Microsoft Excel

#### Start Date

15/11/2018

#### End Date

17/5/2019

#### Type of study

collaborative and participatory design

#### Brief Description

This project explores the use of Excel for musical expression and, as an extension, as a live music coding environment. As such, it would be beneficial to be able to involve the primary stakeholders of the final tool in participatory design [1] for the notation and product. These would be people with a musical background and sufficient technical capabilities. Participants can be involved once a basic working prototype has been developed up until the end of the project [2]. 

The initial structure of interactions with participants would be a brief one-on-one introduction to show the system works with demonstration. Then a task either to compose a piece or write an existing one within the Excel environment. This will be followed by a brief discussion of improvements that could be made or features that could be added. Structured interactions will first be piloted. 

Participants will be volunteers recruited via word of mouth and from friends of Henry. We will also reach out to live coding individual/groups. Alan Blackwell and Advait should be able to provide helpful introductions in these scenarios.

#### Precautions Taken

Before any involvement in the project, participants will be clearly briefed on the aim and scope of the project and it shall be made clear that whilst contributions shall be recognised, there shall be no rewards. Participant shall be kept track of so adequate recognition can be given. However, participants can also choose to remain anonymous.

Personal data shall be kept secure. Data that would allow a respondent to be identified shall be kept in a separate place throughout the research project, with an anonymised code used during analysis work and at publication time. Any personal data shall be destroyed after the project completion. Any data collected shall only be used by Henry and only for the sake of carrying out this project. 

Participants will sign a form acknowledging these terms before they are allowed to view and contribute to prototypes. 

Structured interactions will be piloted and their appropriateness reviewed throughout the duration of the task.
