Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

Microsoft's Advait Sarkar has been working on a mechanism for expressing code relations across numerous cells in Excel. It should be possible to use this mechanism to build a spreadsheet API for music generation. 



Create a converter of some music notation e.g. MIDI to a music specification in Advait’s new “CalculationView” language. That specification will generate a spreadsheet player/visualisation. Adding support for music playback from Excel may be necessary.



Potentially exploring lossless/lossy 'compression' of the MIDI file by, e.g., encoding repeated sections as regions in the spreadsheet grid, or finding note sequences generatable using arithmetic formulas.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

As the project is building on top of new functionality in Excel,
access to the prototype or enough of the codebase will be
required.
