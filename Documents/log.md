| Sunday 21/10    | Start exploring use of add-ins and sound library             | 1    | Found 2 libraries that seem promising for synthesising sound - Tones and Tone | Later excel version required for Adding - have asked Advait.<br><br>The sound API not working in explorer may be a problem however |
| Thursday 25/10  | Get an add in working which I can make changes to            | 3    | Following the instructions Advait sent, got Excel Add in working. This is done in a web version of Excel. This is very basic but it shows I can make changes to an add in | Need to verify that I can indeed make sound. <br><br> Need to find a way to find out what the Library functions are and if there is a better environment for making this changes. Shall ask tomorrow |
| Friday 26/10    | Meeting with Advait                                          | 1    | ScriptLab and VSCode for dev environment<br><br>Dissertation shall lead thought on what live coding / a program is. e.g. musicXML can be compiled to music, is it a program though... probably not<br><br> Can always use Google sheets if web sound API will be an issue | Make noises, research what concepts should be expressible in musical notation, build musician network for testing / feedback, Read through sheetMusic references<br><br>Musician network will require ethics committee sign off |
| Monday 29/10    | Read 2 papers from Sheet Music<br><br>Do add-in tutorial for actually building one | 1.5  | Read and typed up Manhattan paper<br><br>Used Scriptlab and some basic JS to make a beep on button click | Try and add actual beep synthesis, not just calling a sound file. |
| Wednesday 31/10 | Integrate Tones library and make beep via that               | 2    | Integrated the Tones library to the Scriptlab add-in. It also plays the note that is written in the active cell | Still figuring out the typescript stuff. Could do with some resources for that. <br><br>ScriptLab is useful but it's a bad dev environment not least because it's tiny. I'll have to find a new way of doing things.<br><br>Briefly tried doing chords / sequences but neither completely successfully. |
