He was confident that there should be sufficient time to complete the success criteria in addition to some extension tasks. Whilst this is a task that Alan is interested in and introduced me to, for practical reasons, it would make more sense for Advait to be my supervisor. He has successfully supervised part II projects in the past.

We discussed that it would be better to use a more formal music representation such as MusicXML. An initial focus of the project would be to convert this musical representation into the Calculation View language. As edits in Calculation View are propagated to the standard grid, I would not need to edit/understand the structure of Excel files and could interact just with Calculation View.

Extensions: audio output and 'compression'

A version of Excel in Typescript can be used, therefore, it can be run from the browser. As such, music playback shouldn't be a difficult task. This would not be the main focus of the task, but would obviously be nice for a music related project.

The use of compression, in this case, was perhaps a little misleading as we wouldn't be looking to simply reduce the size of the music file but instead look to reduce the size of the representation within the spreadsheet. For example, a repeated chord sequence could only be shown once in the spreadsheet whilst keeping an understandable representation.
