## Final Project Participants Consent Form

The following form is for the participatory design process for Henry Mattinson's individual project as part of the University of Cambridge computer science tripos. The project is the development of a music performance system in Microsoft Excel. 

#### Participatory Design Process

You shall be given a short demonstration on how to use the system in its current version. Using these demos and documentation you shall be given some of the following tasks depending on your familiarity with music: 

* Transcribing some sheet music into the spreadsheet format
* Writing a melody of a song you know
* Making changes to an existing spreadsheet piece

These exercises shall be the starting point for discussion on how the system and its interface can be improved and any feedback or issues you have. If you would rather try a different task, different piece or implementing an idea of your own using the spreadsheet music system, please do. Just make it clear what you are trying to do. The tasks you are given are simply meant to simulate ways in which this may be used. This is not a test, it is an opportunity to help shape the way the system works to be best for you! 

Whilst the project uses Microsoft Excel and is supervised by a Microsoft employee, Microsoft have no ownership in the outcome of the project. It shall be made open source at the end of the academic year in June 2019. Whilst we offer no reward for your input into the project, your contributions shall be recognised. However, you may also remain anonymous.

#### How your data is treated

The session shall be audio recorded to prevent stoppages to write down notes. Using any notes made during this session and this recording a small report on what was discussed during the session shall be written up. Then the audio recording shall then be deleted. 

You shall be issued with an ID that is used to identify your data. If you wish for your data to remain anonymous, no personal data shall be kept with the report. If you do not wish to remain anonymous, your name and contact details shall be kept with your report. Even if your report is not kept anonymous, it shall still only be seen by Henry Mattinson. Please make a note of your ID in case you wish for your data to be made anonymous or deleted.

Your report and personal information will be deleted at the end of the project in June 2018. It shall only be used by Henry Mattinson and only in the context of this project, for no other purpose. Only Henry shall have access to this data. It shall be stored on his password protected laptop. An encrypted folder shall also be backed up on GitHub.
