Microsoft's Advait Sarkar has been working on a mechanism for expressing code relations across numerous cells in Excel. It should be possible to use this mechanism to build a spreadsheet API for music generation. 



Create a converter of some music notation e.g. MIDI to a music specification in Advait’s new “CalculationView” language. That specification will generate a spreadsheet player/visualisation. Adding support for music playback from Excel may be necessary.



Potentially exploring lossless/lossy 'compression' of the MIDI file by, e.g., encoding repeated sections as regions in the spreadsheet grid, or finding note sequences generatable using arithmetic formulas.
