\section{Motivation}

\paragraph{} There exist many programs for music notation and composition. Sibelius (fig \ref{intro:interfaces} (a)) allows users to write scores using traditional western music notation, whilst music is produced in the live programming interface Sonic Pi (fig \ref{intro:interfaces} (b)) by real-time editing of Ruby code \cite{aaron:pi}. These require users to gain familiarity with a new interface, often with a large threshold to creating simple musical ideas. There are four times more spreadsheet users than programmers \cite{scaffidi:estimating}, it being the preferred programming language for many people \cite{blackwell:functions}. I believe that this ubiquituity, along with the affordances of the spreadsheet, would enable new ways to interact with musical notation that capitalise on existing familiarities with spreadsheets and their data handling capabilities.

\paragraph{} The use of grid structures is an established concept in music programs, with most sequencing software using one axis of the screen for time and the other for pitch or musical parts. Chris Nash's Manhattan \cite{nash:manhattan} (fig \ref{intro:interfaces} (c)) uses a grid structure where formulae can be defined in the cells to change the cell value, much like in a spreadsheet. However, it is limited to columns defining tracks and rows corresponding to different times. Advait Sarkar's SheetMusic \cite{sarkar:sheetmusic} investigated how formulae with sound output can be included within the spreadsheet paradigm. This also introduced abstracting time away from the grid, in this case using an incrementing global \texttt{tick} variable which could be referred to in the formulae. Both axes can be used interchangeably for SheetMusic notation or markup that the user wishes to include which is not interpreted musically, a concept idiomatic to Excel usage. Simple formulae such as \texttt{if(tick\%2==0) p('snare') else p('kick')} allow musical structures to be defined without advanced programming knowledge but quickly become unwieldy for defining larger pieces, especially if they are not highly repetitive. Whilst other spreadsheet music projects exist \cite{hackaday:spreadsheet}, these simply use the spreadsheet as the medium for conventional sequencing with an auxiliary script used to parse the grid and create musical output.

\paragraph{} Excello (fig \ref{intro:interfaces} (d)) is an Excel add-in for end-user music programming where users define music in the spreadsheet and can play it back from within Excel. It maintains the abstraction of time from the grid to keep the flexibility spreadsheets offer but was designed so individual cells would not become too complex. Existing functionality within Excel can be used, both accelerating the learning curve and increasing the available functionality.

\section{Outline of work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item I designed a system for musical expression and playback within Excel and built a prototype satisfying the all the success criteria for the system.

\item Participatory design began using this initial prototype. Following formative evaluation sessions with 21 participants, issues and feature requests were identified. Users continued to give feedback as they used the updated prototypes.

\item A series of extensions were implemented, solving problems identified by participants and adding requested feature.

\item A converter from MIDI to the Excello format was built to translate a large corpus of MIDI files to the Excello notation.

\item Summative evaluation was performed with the participants. Evaluating the features implemented during participatory design and Excello's usability using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notation (CDN) framework \cite{blackwell:tutorial}, using Sibelius as a comparison.

\end{enumerate}
