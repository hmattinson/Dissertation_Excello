# Introduction

There exist many programs for music notation and composition. Sibelius allows users to write scores using traditional western music notation, whilst the live programming interface Sonic Pi produces music from the real time editing of Ruby code. However, these require users to gain familiarity with a new interface, often with a large threshold to creating simple musical ideas. Spreadsheet users significantly outnumber programmers \cite{scaffidi:estimating} being the preferred programming language for many people \cite{blackwell:functions}. I believe that this ubiquitousness, along with the affordances of the spreadsheet, would enable new ways to interact with musical notation that capitalise on existing familiarities with spreadsheets and their data handling capabilities. 

The use of grid structures is an established concept in music programs, with most sequencing software using one axis of the screen for time and the other for pitch or musical parts. Chris Nash's Manhattan \cite{Nash:Manhattan} Advait Sarkar's SheetMusic \cite{sardar:sheetmusic} investigated how formulae with sound output can be included within the spreadsheet paradigm. This also explored abstracting time away from the grid so both axes can be used interchangeably for the system's notation in addition to markup that the user wishes to include which is not interpreted musically. 

Excello is a system for music production built out of Microsoft's Excel.
