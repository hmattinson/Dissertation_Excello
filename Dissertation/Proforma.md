# Proforma

The main aim of the project was to create a system for music expression and playback allowing users to play individual notes and chords and define their durations, define multiple parts, play loops, define sequences of notes and chords and be able to call these for playback and define the tempo of playback. Followed by the implementation of a converter from an existing musical notation to the Excel system (with compression as an extension) and usability testing of the Excel system. 

I designed a notation for music expression in Excel and built a prototype (Excello) satisfying the success criteria above. Participatory design sessions with 21 users served as formative evaluation leading to the implementation of many additional features as extensions. I contributed part of my implementation to an open-source library, this has been merged and published. I built a converter from MIDI to the Excello notation which can convert exactly or perform lossy compression. This was used to translate a corpus of music to the Excello notation. I performed summative evaluation with the users from the participatory design.
